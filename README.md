# PacMan
This is a remake of the popular arcade game, Pac-Man. The player can navigate the map by using the arrow keys on
the keyboard. To win, the player must eat all yellow points. The player loses if a ghost is touched, except
if the ghost is scared. To make a ghost scared, a big yellow point must be eaten. When a ghost is scared,
it can be eaten for a short period of time, and will respawn in the centre of the board.
